# Day 007: Binary Addition Finite State Automata

Link: [https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/day-7-binary-addition-fsa-cfb275ac9253](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/day-7-binary-addition-fsa-cfb275ac9253)

## Notes to myself

1. Draw the finite state diagram.
2. Revise K-map taught in CS2100 Computer Organisation which will help reducing the states variables.
3. `Example.kt` is the Kotlin translation from [here](http://www.transylvania-jug.org/archives/396).
4. Current implementation can only handle same length addition of binary numbers. Can be improved by appending missing zero to the shorter binary string.
